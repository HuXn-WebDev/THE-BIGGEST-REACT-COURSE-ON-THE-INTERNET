### Exercise: Using `useRef` in React

In this exercise, you will learn how to:

- Use `useRef` to reference DOM elements.
- Use `useRef` to store values that persist between renders without triggering re-renders.

---

### Step 1: Accessing a DOM Element with `useRef`

1. Create a new file called `FocusInput.jsx`.
2. Inside this file, create a functional component that will focus on an input field when a button is clicked, using the `useRef` hook.

### Step 2: Persisting Values Between Renders with `useRef`

1. Create a new file called `Timer.jsx`.
2. Inside this file, create a component that implements a simple timer, where the timer’s interval is stored using `useRef`.
